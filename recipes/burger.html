    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            500g Certified Irish Angus Beef Mince
        </li>
        <li>
            1x egg mixed well
        </li>
        <li>
            Salt & pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            1x small white onion, diced
        </li>
        <li>
            1x Tsp parsley (fresh or dried)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Put all patty ingredients into a bowl and using your hands, mix until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide the mince into four and using your hands roll each into a ball. Using the palm of your hands, press gently against the patties to flatten until 3cm thick.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make sure all burgers are the same thickness so that they cook evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Put on a plate, cover with cling-film and place in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to firm up.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add oil to a non-stick large frying pan and when hot add the patties, ensuring there is space between each so that they do not stick to each other. Cook only two at a time to ensure they fry and donâ€™t steam.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fry the burgers for 5-6 minutes on each side until cooked through.
        </li>
    </ol>
